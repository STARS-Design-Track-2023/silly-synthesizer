## Silly Synthesizer
A synthesizer with multiple note buttons, two octave buttons (one for raising the octave one for lowering), a button to select the shape of the wave, and a goof-off button.

## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and labels

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams
