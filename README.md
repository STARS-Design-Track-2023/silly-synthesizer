# STARS 2023 Design Final Project

## Silly Synth Specialists (Triple SSS)

* Adam Mack
* Andre Ponsot
* Noah Rediker

## Silly Synthesizer
A synthesizer with the following specifications:
- Thirteen note buttons to play an entire octave from C to C
- Two octave buttons to raise or lower the octave being played
- One button to change the shape of the wave between off, triangle, sawtooth, and square modes
- One button to goof-off.

## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and label
Input: GPIO [0:12] keyboard, [13] mode key, [14:15] octave change, [16] goof-off
Output: GPIO [33] PWM

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams
