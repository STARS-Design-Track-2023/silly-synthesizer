# STARS 2023 Design Final Project

## [Triple SSS]
* Ethan Christie
* Adam Mack
* Austin Bohlmann
* Andre Ponsot
* Noah Rediker

## [Silly Synthesizer]
The synthesizer will play notes over a five octave range, over four different modes of wave. It will also have the ability to play a series of random notes 4 times a second when the "goof-off mode" is activated.

## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and labels

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams

## Statement from Purdue
Pending
