## Silly Synthesizer
Description of functionality, how to use it, and any supporting equipment required
This project uses SystemVerilog to create a simple synthesizer. The design will be able to interface with a speaker!

## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and labels

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams

## Statement from Purdue
